# React Calculator

This is a simple calculator application built with React. It can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also has a clear button to clear the input field. Because this is the first project I've done, so inevitably copy existing source code to learn and understand how it works. I will try to understand the code and make some changes to it.

## Introduction

This project was developed as part of a React course on Udemy. The goal of the project is to apply the concepts learned during the course to build a functional calculator application. The project covers the following key concepts:

- Component-based architecture
- State management
- Event handling
- JSX syntax
- Styling in React
