\subsection{What have I learned}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In the past, my approach was sequential programming, but this task has broadened my knowledge to include the fundamentals of object-oriented programming.
    \item I’ve acquired skills in creating reports with \LaTeX.
    \item I’ve employed Github as a vault for my source code and reports, all of which are securely stored in \href{https://github.com/KhoaNguyen-HCMUS/HCMUS-course}{my personal repository}.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{What was my difficult}
\begin{itemize}
    \item At the outset, my journey with programming was fraught with difficulties due to my unfamiliarity with object-oriented programming. However, my comprehension has been greatly enhanced after delving into a plethora of resources available on the internet. \cite{OOP_in_C++}
    \item I encountered some difficulties when writing function about AVL tree. However, after a period of debugging and contemplation, I successfully resolved the issues. \cite{AVL_Tree}
    \item I had a hard time understanding the concept of hash tables, but after a period of research and experimentation, I was able to grasp the fundamentals.
    \item Measuring the time complexity of the algorithms was a challenging task, but I was able to overcome it by using the Chrono library in C++. \cite{Measure_time_in_C++}
    \item Lastly, my English proficiency isn’t quite up to par yet, so there’s a possibility that this report contains some grammatical errors.
\end{itemize}
