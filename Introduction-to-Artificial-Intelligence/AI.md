# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

## Lab 01: Ares’s adventure

- Description: This project requires implementing search algorithms to help Ares solve a maze by optimally pushing weighted stones onto switches, using **BFS, DFS, UCS, A*, and Greedy Best-First Search**; students are also encouraged to explore **Dijkstra’s, Swarm, Convergent Swarm, Bidirectional Swarm, and Ant Colony Optimization** algorithms.

## Lab 02: Hashiwokakero

- Description: This project involves developing a **Hashiwokakero (Bridges)** puzzle solver using **CNF logic**, requiring implementation of **CNF constraint generation**, solving with **PySAT**, and applying **A*, brute-force, and backtracking** algorithms for performance comparison.

## Lab 03:  Decision Tree

- Description: This project requires building decision trees using **scikit-learn** on real-world datasets, including the binary-class **Breast Cancer dataset**, the multi-class **Wine Quality dataset**, and an additional dataset chosen by the student, with at least **300 labeled samples** for **supervised learning**.

## Lab 04: Air Quality Sensor Calibration Using Linear Models

- Description: This project focuses on calibrating electrochemical **air quality sensors** by building regression models—starting with **linear models** and potentially extending to more advanced methods—to accurately predict **O₃ and NO₂** levels from sensor voltage outputs, addressing **cross-sensitivity issues**.
